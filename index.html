            <li>How can you change the layout of the lists from top-down to having three columns?</li>
                <p>In my css, add the following to my ul and/or ol elements:</p>
                <p>columns: 3</p>
                <p>I've added this to the main.css of this project, but have it commented out</p>

            <li>How would your ERD change if the customer had the following, new requirement?
                <br>Each dock will only service some of the hauling ships because of contracts with their companies. For example, Rotterdam will only service "Seawise Giant" and "Pioneering Spirit", and Busan will service "Seawise Giant" and "Boaty McBoatface". Each hauling ship can be serviced by many docks, and each dock can service one, or more, hauling ships. You need to keep track of the allowed relationships in your database.
